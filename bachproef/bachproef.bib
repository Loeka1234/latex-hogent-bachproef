  abstract  = {Mapping Data Flows is the code-free data transformation feature in Azure Data Factory that allows data engineers to build powerful ETL jobs at scale. You can interactively design and test your data flow logic against live data and data samples while constructing a data transformation graph using the Mapping Data Flows designer UI. Then, you can operationalize your work as a Data Flow activity inside of an ADF pipeline. The Azure Integration Runtime is utilized for both debugging and pipeline executions of your data flows, while ADF manages an ephemeral and elastic Spark environment for you in a serverless manner. Throughout the next chapters in this book, I'll refer to the experience of building ETL logic as Mapping Data Flows, the pipeline activity to execute your work as Data Flows, and sometimes will shorten the full name to MDF.},

  abstract  = {Databricks is an analytics service based on the Apache Spark open source project. Apache Spark is a batch processing and real time processing environment. Apache Spark is quite popular among data scientists because of its ability to analyze huge amounts of data, its streaming capabilities, graph computation, machine learning, and interactive queries engine. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing. One of the popular tools for big data analytics on Spark is Databricks. Databricks has been used for ingesting a significant amount of data, cleaning data, applying machine learning, and so forth. In February 2018, there was an integration between Microsoft Azure and Databricks that provides a better collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, and data analytics. This integration provides data science and data engineering teams with a fast, easy, and collaborative Spark-based platform in Azure [1]. Azure Databricks is a new platform for big data analytics and machine learning. The notebook in Azure Databricks enables data engineers, data scientists, and business analysts to collaborate using a single tool. This chapter gives an overview of what Azure Databricks is, the environment it inhabits, and its use in data science.},

  abstract  = {In the previous chapter, you learned about Mapping Data Flows in ADF and how to design an ETL pattern for data quality checking, cleaning, and prep. Now that we have a working data flow artifact, we need to execute it from a pipeline. Previously, we were able to peek at samples of the results while designing our logic. This was useful from the perspective of unit testing. The next step in building your ETL solution in ADF will be to test the data flow inside of a pipeline against the full dataset and execute from a debug session. Executing your data flow in the pipeline will write the data out to an ADLS Gen2 data lake folder as parquet. After verifying the results, we'll build an ETL data pipeline in the ADF pipeline designer that will provide rich workflow capabilities by adding control flow and other activity types in addition to the data flow activity.},
